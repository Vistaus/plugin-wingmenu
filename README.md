# Wing Menu is an alternative menu plugin for [lxqt-panel](https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt-panel)

It has two columns instead of the "classic menu" and was inspired by Xfce's [Whisker Menu](https://docs.xfce.org/panel-plugins/xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin/start)

liblxqt-globalkeys-ui0-dev liblxqt-globalkeys0-dev
```

#### Arch Linux

### Compile and install plugin:

```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/elviosak/plugin-wingmenu.git

# cd into folder
cd plugin-wingmenu

# run install script

#### Note: it's not well integrated with actual LXQt Themes, try it with "System" theme and "Fusion" widget style.

WIP branch for Wing Menu styling in themes: https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt-themes/tree/wing-menu-fixes


If everything was successful, you should have a new plugin ready to be added to your panel, named `Wing Menu (wingmenu)`.
